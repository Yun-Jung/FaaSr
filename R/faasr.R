# The package implements the following functions:
# faasr_start - start the execution of the function; takes a JSON string as argument
# faasr_parse - parse the JSON payload, returns a parsed list if payload validation is successful
# faasr_get_user_function_args - extract user function arguments from parsed list
# faasr_put_file - put a file from local storage to S3
# faasr_get_file - get a file from S3 to local storage
# faasr_log - append to a log file stored in S3
# faasr_trigger - generate trigger(s) for any additional user-specified actions

# faasr_start is the function that starts execution of the user-supplied function
# faasr_start is the entry point invoked by the FaaS platform (e.g. OpenWhisk, Lambda, GH Actions) when a container starts
# faasr_payload is a JSON file payload containing all configuration key/value pairs for this invocation
faasr_start <- function(faasr_payload) {
  # First, call faasr_parse to validate the JSON payload, return parsed list
  faasr <- faasr_parse(faasr_payload)

  # TBD first, need to check for parsing error and schema compliance and return if there's an error parsing/validating the JSON file
  
  # TBD second, need to check if the log server is correctly configured, otherwise return an error
  
  # TBD third, need to check if the rest of the JSON payload is correctly configured - for anything incorrect, use faasr_log to log to S3, and then return an error
  
  # TBD if there is an empty InvocationID in the JSON, generate a UUID at random and add to faasr
  # i.e. the first function in the invocation generates a UUID that is carried over to any others it triggers
  
  # Now extract the name of the user-provided function to invoke
  user_function = get(faasr$FunctionInvoke)
  
  # TBD let's do this later - need to come up with a strategy for dealing with a function that is a dependence "sink", 
  # i.e. it depends/is triggered by multiple other functions and should only execute when the last trigger has been received
  
  # Invoke the user function, passing the parsed list as argument
  faasr_result <- user_function(faasr)
  
  # Now trigger the next actions(s) if any
